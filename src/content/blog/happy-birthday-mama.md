## To my Mother on her 73rd Birthday...

Dear Mom,

Here is your very own website! It is simple but actually has a lot of very fun & useful features. We can even set up an email on this domain name (I'll wait for you to tell me the username).

We can customize this however you like. Add pictures, change the color, literally can change everything and anything. We can even embed a newsletter sign up form. And as an added perk - this is all 100% free!

## 10 reasons why you are the best mom in the world:

1. You are always there for me no matter what. Through all my ups and downs, you listen, give advice, and reassure me that everything will be okay.

2. You taught me how to be kind, thoughtful, honest, and hardworking. Your example made me the man I am today.

3. Your cooking is the best! You are always trying new recipes and never dissapoint. From Asian cuisine to outlandish desserts, cooking is 10/10.

4. You encouraged me to follow my dreams. Even when it seemed impossible, your faith in me kept me going.

5. Our relationship means everything to me. I cherish our talks, jokes, and time spent together. You are my best friend.

6. Your smile and laugh brighten my day. Hearing you happy fills me with joy.

7. You give the warmest, most comforting hugs. Whenever I need reassurance, your arms are there.

8. Your selflessness and caring for our family inspires me daily.

9. You are so strong. You handle every challenge with grace and perseverance.

10. You are beautiful inside and out. Your compassion and spirit make you shine.

### Bonus reason

11. You are very good at Wordle!

P.S. We can take down the Giraffe pic. Nobody knows this site exists, yet. ðŸ˜Ž

## Technical use

Mom, I have made this website extremely easy (for convenience sake of course) to use and update! No coding!

Please do not be afraid to brag about your technical prowess. My mom started Condrey Software (Language Learning Software) in the 1980s before Rosetta Stone and even before domain names! Whoo!!

## On your special day

I am glad you and Dad made it back from Canada safely. I am still not sure what we have planned but I know whatever we do will be lots of fun.

## Love you!

Love Always,

Your Son, Will

(And Bill, who helped in Spirit)
